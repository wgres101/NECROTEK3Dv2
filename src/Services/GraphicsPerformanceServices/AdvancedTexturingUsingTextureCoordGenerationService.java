//M_LIGHT THE LIGHT MATRIX USED TO TRANSFROM TGHE GEOMETRY FROM WORLD SPACE TO LIGHT SPACE

//M_PROJ THE LIGHTS PROJECTGION MATRIX

//M_SCALE 0.5 SCALE MATRIX

//M_TRANS = 0.5 TRANLASATON MATRIX

//SPHERE MAP
//==============
//Incident rays reflect off of the sphere
//the sphere is infinitely small like a mathematical ;point
//Not feasible to do every posible ray (technically 
//Use a spherical reflection map (or just sphere map)
//SPhere Map: Basic ddefinition of a sphere map is a texture map  
//that contains a full 360-degrfee vie wof the environment surround ing
