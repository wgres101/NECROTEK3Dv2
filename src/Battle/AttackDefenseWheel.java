 * Attack/Defense Wheel

At the top middle of the screen is a wheel that can be filled up by tapping rapidly on an attack button (spell buttons count too). The further the wheel is to being full, the more the enemy is damaged and frozen (in the air too) like Devil May Cry. If you are on the defensive and blocking, tapping the attack button very fast will cause the meter to switch to defense and start filling. When the defense meter is full, your character becomes temporarily invulnerable.
