Switching

Switch character - slow motion 1-3 (use tank to defend, swordsman uppercut swing) When character hits the switch button the screen slows down to a matrix like bullet-time, but the player character still operates in real time. This way if a heavy attack is coming in, the player can switch to his tank from his weaker character.

The switching thing is not spammable so you have to make the energy bar like in streetfighter where it builds up to be used for special attacks, so now players can choose to switch or use special attacks

When you switch there should be commands. (So while you are in bullet-time for lack of a better word?) For as long as in bullet-time you can execute whatever attacks you want like you normally would.

You do the switch when a monster is about to attack, you switch to a tank either on screen or an off-screen character. You can't just walk normally to the guy that is going to be hit because that would look weird, so there are commands that replace his skills momentarily to blink to the character and defend.

Make Juggling/Combo hard and not easy to do and should not be able to repeat nonstop

Implements a Devil May Cry type combo system, that is, when the current character is  firing a projectile towards the enemy while the enemy is in the air will keep them immobilized In the air. Think when Dante uses his guns, but obviously we won’t be using guns but maybe a fireball spell.


when you switch, cam will go behind the switched character and everything still in slow motion, you switched to a tank but you're far away, what can you do at this point, you only have like 1-5 sec to do something, you can't just walk to the other guy, so the only solution is the teleport thing.

The casters cast spells just in rapid fire until they run out of MP (which recharges but slowly). To compensate for the balance in power, we buff up the melee characters. This will avoid spamming enemies using magic.
