//event manager is the heart of the scheduler
//each task in the task manager defines
//one or more events it handles
//

//event manager sits in a loop
//watches a real=time clock
//and as son as a target time is reached
//it fires an event


//The event manager handles the sequencing and generation of events
//Since tasks are triggered by events, proper ordering occurs naturally
