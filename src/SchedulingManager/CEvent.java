//Frame Events are simplest types of events and occur once per N frames or every frame
//They can also occur before and after a render event
//Time Events on the other hand, occur in virtual time and are not
//specifically synchronized with frames

//For example, time events can occur every 10 ms
//regardless of the rendering frame
