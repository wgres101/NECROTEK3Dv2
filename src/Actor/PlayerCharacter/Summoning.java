Summoning little monster minions is easy cause it can be just more AI's for a certain duration on your side but if you want to go into big gods then the best way I think is to merge the guy who summoned it with the god, so like riding on it and all skills will be replaced to w.e the god does.

I like the merger idea. As far a  I know this isn’t being done – that is, a summoner summoning a god-beast to merge with. Summoning little monster minions has less of a dramatic, and fun, effect.  IMHO. I really LOVE the summons in Final Fantasy 7 and Final Fantasy X and I think if we could come close to that kind of quality we would have a great game. Again, that’s just my opinion.

If you can find a way to merge DMC with Vindictus then that would be best for pc, if you think about it, pc games is either FPS, Top Down, or 3rd person (MMO like wow, hold right click to move cam around) those are the best types imo but its time for something new.
