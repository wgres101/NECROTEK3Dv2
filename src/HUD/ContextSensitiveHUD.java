public class ContextSensitiveHUD {

	//fulfills the following requirements
	
	
	//Automation - Eliminate the changing of tools all the time
	//User-interface Simplification - Most of the little links on the
	//			toolbar can be removed since they won't be used anyway
	//Learning curve reduction and productivity increase
	//		Learning how to use the tool taks less time
	
	// Build  the system in layers, so each later is like the 
	// layer of acetate (overhead projection film)
	// Each layer is transparent and overlaps the others
	// Each HUD renders itself transparently on top of the 
	// the rest of the viewpoert.
	
	// The user has a simple tool to choose the layer they are in
	// Each tool has one or more acetates, the fewer the better
	
	// Each HUD is unique and encapsulated into a class of its own
	// So there is a HUD Manager and HUDs layered together
	
	// Treat the layers of the HUD like a stack that can pop and push
	
	//
