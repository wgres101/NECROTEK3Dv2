 * Snap Camera (borrowing from Guild Chronicles)


I’m looking at Ryse and I’m getting an idea. I personally hate using the mouse and keyboard combination for 3rd person views. Without auto targeting and with a completely mouse controlled camera I won’t play the game. (Hence the Doom 3 reference, its sitting in my closet but I wanted to play it so I just bought it off amazon a few days ago for xbox.

Now like I was saying, looking at Ryse , maybe we can do something unique with the camera and keep the mouse still in play,. But instead of moving
the mouse to look around, the smart camera focuses over the shoulder of the default character. Possibly auto-targeting (for guns - with an option to turn it off) as well. What do you think of that? 

Could we use a sort of ‘snap’ targeting where the mouse will move the camera and zoom in and zoom out, but as soon as you leave go the camera
will snap back into the smart cam. I think this would be best but maybe we should brainstorm this a bit.

The transition from this to a console controller would be easy too. left analog stick controls walking, right analog stick controls the snap camera.
