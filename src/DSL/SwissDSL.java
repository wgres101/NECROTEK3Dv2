		Our visual scripting system gives artists and level designers virtually limitless control over how a level will play without touching a single line of code.
			Allows for connecting together simple events and actions, created by programmers, to quickly assemble everything from simple behaviors to complete gameplay prototypes.
			Has support for Math, Conditional Logic, Event handling and performing Actions.
			Kismet visual scripting supports hierarchies of scripts for organizing very complex sequences into manageable units.
			Lets programmers easily extend and create their own game-specific actions and events.
			An intuitive user interface allows you to drop events and variables onto a canvas and control program flow by dragging connectors between objects. Comment boxes allow you to clearly group and organize bodies of code.
	Web browser-style “Back” and “Forward” buttons and a streamlined Search feature allow you to easily navigate complex scripts with many sub-routines.

Unreal Script provides a safe sandbox for game code programming, with a lot of powerful built-in features for game development like serialization and networking.
One of the most powerful features of UnrealScript is the built-in concept of states. Classes can define multiple states, with functions scoped to these states. In addition, state code can use “latent functions” whose execution occurs over multiple frames.
Unrealscript can also directly call “native functions” which provide an interface to access all the powerful game code related systems of the game engine, like collision traces and path finding.
