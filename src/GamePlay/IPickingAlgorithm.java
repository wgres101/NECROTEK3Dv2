 * NECROTEK PICKING ALGORITHM

Able to move around objects using mouse. For example, if a skill arrow is shot into a tree, you can click on it and it says the name
 of a skill. You can also drag it to your character, and the skill gets put in the characters backpack.

You can also do things like picking a loaf of bread and eating it or double clicking on a potion on a table and drink it, or
something as simple as move one stick of butter from one table to another.
