	 * In-Game Physics

Generate real-time physics and bizarre physics such as alternate forms of gravity.

Have to walk more carefully over slippy terrain. Can walk faster over normal terrain. Edge along the side o a cliff very slowly, swing through the forest?

			NECROTEK PhAT - Visual physics modeling tool built right into NECROTEK Editor. Build and tweak your physics directly with this in-editor.
			Intense Physics - Rigid bodies, soft bodies, elastics, ragdoll characters and dismemberable objects are directly in your control.
			Animation Blending - Combine physics and animations in new ways by blending existing animations together.
			Vehicle Support - Fully integrated vehicle physics support allows you to easily add vehicles, for use by the player or AI, both solo and online.
			Crowd System - NECROTEK flocking technology allows you to simulate crowds of hundreds of characters within a scene.
			Destructible Environments - NECROTEK  Ed’s fracture tool and NVIDIA’s APEX Destruction both allow you or your player to realistically tear your entire world apart, piece by piece.
	Simulated Clothing - NVIDIA’s APEX Clothing enables you to bring character clothing to life and create immersive ambient cloth effects.

Friction, Velocity, Trajectory, Angles, etc.. If I blow something up, a box nearby should move from the pressure change.

Realistic reactions to force. Getting hit with a boulder crushes someone.

Intertia, Mass, Velocity. Enemies take impact – fly backwards, do flips.

Bump into a trash can and it will topple over and roll down the hill

Dead bodies will slide down incline

Pin Point Accuracy Collision
Projectile Motion – Cast rays instead of random

Climb trees, fall, swim, crawl
You have to walk more carefully over slippery terrain, faster over flat terrain,
Slightly slower over rocky terrain. Edge your way along the side of  a cliff, Stalk through the trees of a forest.

Do rolls, somersaults, cartwheels, jump kicks, etc. like Tomb Raider series
