ARCHITECUTRE AND DESIGN



1) Every object (such as a cube or sphere all the way to a rigidbody component) has its
own WebService and WSObject. The WebService controls all the functionality -that is
the game logic, and WSObject contains the data of an instance of a Web Service.

2) Every object has its own place in the scene graph. This includes scripts,
skeletal meshes, nav meshes, AI behaviors, ProjectileMovement objects, 
static meshes, etc. 

3) Every object has a WSObject which translates to a details panel. For example,
I may add a primitie cube with a brick texture. That is added to the scene graph. When 
the scene graph is iterated and reaches the box, it calls the box's primitive's 
web service with a newly created WSObject for the box. SHould the user click on
the box, on the right hand side a panel will appear for the box containing all
the box's variables that can be adjusted (position, texture, m ash type, etc.) in
the inspector

4) Also, when a node is reached on the scene graph, since EVERY implementation of
a node on the scene graph MUST implement three functions: create, update, and destroy,
when the obejct is reached during iteration it will immediately call that object's
Update method. 


5) The Blackboard object is a means for services to comunicate with each other. Important
variables are placed on the blackboard allowing for other services to check their values.
